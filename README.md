# Clapper
A GNOME media player built using [GJS](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gjs) and powered by [GStreamer](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org) with [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org) rendering. Can also be used as a pre-made widget for [Gtk](https://www.gtk.org) apps.

<b>WORK IN PROGRESS</b>

## Requirements
Clapper uses these `GStreamer` elements:
* [gtkglsink](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/gtk/gtkglsink.html)
* [glsinkbin](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/opengl/glsinkbin.html)

Other required plugins (codecs) depend on video format.

To use `VAAPI` make sure you have `gstreamer1-vaapi` installed. Verify with:
```shell
gst-inspect-1.0 vaapi
```
On some older GPUs you might need to export `GST_VAAPI_ALL_DRIVERS=1` environment variable.
